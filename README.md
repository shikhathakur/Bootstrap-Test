In this application,i used bootstrap-css and bootstrap-js .In the application if we click on Dashboard(header) we need to get the title description and also four tiles.If we click on view details button on any of the tile the modal should appear which displays the related tile details.If we click on  Home(header),we should get the carousel(get images through ajax) and table that take employee data when we click on create employee button through modal.The table has edit ,view and delete button. If we click on event(header) ,nothing should be displayed.If we click on tab1 ,then we need display a panel that gets the data through json object.
